# Name-IT-Turtlebot-

This code is to make a Turtlebot in turtlesim package of ROS write a string called "ROBO-SAPIENS".

The documentation and comments have not been done very well explaining which part of the code in the entire function is to write which letter in the code.
Anyone who could please add the documentation explaining this informative code for beginners in ROS who would really like to understand the code, please feel free to reach out to me.
